# 🛠 Developer Notes - BJITCoin

## 📌 Investigation Summary

During the early stages of developing **BJITCoin**, we thoroughly evaluated popular smart contract libraries, including JasmyCoin and others, to ensure our implementation would be secure, extensible, and ERC-20 compliant.

Our investigation led us to **OpenZeppelin**, which stood out due to its security audits, community support, and modular architecture.

---

## 🎯 Objectives of the Investigation

We defined clear goals for selecting the right smart contract framework:

### 🔐 1. Security & Audit Quality

- Well-audited and community-trusted
- Proven in real-world projects
- Avoids reentrancy, overflows, and other known vulnerabilities

### 🧱 2. Modularity & Extensibility

- Composable via inheritance
- Extendable with role-based modules (minting, burning, governance)

### ✅ 3. ERC-20 Standard Compliance

- Wallet support (MetaMask, Trust Wallet)
- DEX compatibility (Uniswap)
- Explorer integration (Etherscan)

### ⚙️ 4. Development Integration

- Easy to use with **Hardhat**
- Comprehensive documentation and examples
